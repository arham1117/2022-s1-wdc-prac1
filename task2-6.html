        <h1>Checkout my borders</h1>

        <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8 px radius.  </p>

        <p>Other elements can have borders too,<span class= "red-border">like this span with the class red-border.</span></p>
        <hr>
        <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
        <br>all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span>
        <br>That prevents it from messing with the line height.
        </p>
        </div>

            <p>Notice how the borders double here:
            </p>
        <div>

            <div class="red-border">
            This div has a red border
            </div>

            <div class="blue-border">
            This div has a blue border
            </div>

            <p>
                Notice how this fixes the borders:
            </p>
            <div class="red-border-rounded">
                This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners
            </div>
            <div class="blue-border-rounded">
                This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners
            </div>
